These strategies have enabled athletes to have sound financial support to focus on their studies, train better during school sessions and vacations and train at high - performing centers.Through the combination of academics and sports,students from the University of Ghana have earned call - upsfor national assignments in various sporting disciplines.With student - athletes who have gone the extra also earning full scholarships to further their studies and sports careers abroad,especially in the United States of America.In recent times,most of these athletes have represented Ghana at major international events such as the African Games in 2015 and 2019 in Congo Brazzaville and Rabat,Morocco respectively,the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast,Australia,the World Athletics Championship in Doha,Qatar in 2019 and Oregon,USA in 2022 and the Olympic Games in 2022. As much as the athletes have received call - ups,the coaches have also received invitations to guide the teams at these prestigious sports festivals.Notable among them was Daniel Opare Okyere,who coached the Ghana Swim Team at the 2018 Africa Swimming Championships in Tunisia and the 2022 Olympic Games in Japan.Elorm Amenakpor recently coached the Ghana athletes at the 2022 World Athletics Championships in Oregon,Eugene,USA.With the Commonwealth Games ongoing,we look at some students and alumnus who have been nurtured by UG Sports Directorate and are representing Ghana at the Games.While studying at UG,Azamati ran his fastest time of 10.31 seconds at the Ghana Fastest and won goldfor Ghana in the 4 x100m at the African Games in Morocco after 16 years of waiting.He was also part of Ghana 's 4x100m men's relay team,finishing 5 th in the just ended World Athletics Championships in Oregon,USA.In 2022,he signed a professional contract with ASICS and is a force to reckon with in the 100 m event.Saminu a beneficiary of both UG - PAAS and UG - SF made his personal best of 10.31 seconds in 100 m at his first international competition at the 10 th Federation of African University Sports(FASU) Games in Nairobi,Kenya in June 2022.

        "headline": "The University of Ghana Debate Society has been crowned champions of the maiden Inter-School Spring Debate Championship. The Championship which was organised and hosted by the Student Executive Council of the Lancaster University Ghana was their first debate activity as a Debate Society.",
        "description": "In a welcome address, the Student Executive Council President of the Lancaster University Ghana Mr. Papa Nyan Niezer was grateful to the University of Ghana Debate Society for honouring the invitation to participate in the Championship. He was hopeful the Championship would foster a good relationship between the two Debate Societies in the transfer of knowledge and resources.The UG Debate Society represented by Yolanda Ofosu Kwadey, Cecil Adrian Sampson and Anastasia Ahenkan Nkrumah spoke against the motion “This House as Africa (African Union) would not pick sides in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian conflict.” Team UG argued primarily that for the sake of basic decency and humanity, the African continent has an obligation to speak up on the Russo-Ukrainian war. They further added that the conflict has had ripple effects on various aspects of our lives such as the hike in fuel costs and consequently living costs and such speaking up is also in line with protecting ourselves and all other affected parties suffering from the result of the conflict. In closing their arguments, Team UG vehemently opposed the motion with a principle in line with ideas postulated by other great thinkers such as Martin Luther King Jr,stating that whenever and wherever there is aggression in the world, silence under the guise of neutrality is an unspoken position,an implicit affirmation of the actions of the aggressor.The Judges for the Championship, Ms.Precious Bonsu(Educational Consultant, Author and Founder of Whale Learning Group) and Mr.Henry Nii Dottey(Head, Marketing and Corporate Communications at UBA Ghana Limited) congratulated both Universities for delivering excellent speeches.They were intrigued by the confidence, clarity of thought and practical examples given to support the arguments made.They encouraged both Societies to continue the sport of debate on their respective campuses to help promote intellectual discourse as they contribute to national and international discussions.Team UG came first with a total score point of 20.87 while Lancaster University Ghana placed second with 20.75.Participants received medals and certificates of participation.UG received a trophy for winning the maiden Championship. Mr.Lawrence Nii Kotey Neequaye, Coach of UG Debate Team explained that he was excited that his side won and was happy to see the passion and zest with which the debate team from Lancaster approached the exercise.It was evidently a clash of brilliant and well - informed ideas and perspectives, and more importantly a learning experience for our team,Mr.Neequaye added.",
